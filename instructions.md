# Academy of Arts and Culture

In this portfolio project, you'll build a minimal landing page for an art academy.

This mockup has 5 main parts: the navigation, banner, main section, browse section and the footer.

## Getting Started Notes

- You're not given any HTML markup inside of the `<body></body>` tags, first start by outlining the main elements. Once you have done that, you can start implementing the styles. You'll be expected to edit `style.css` to implement the styles. 

- The `style.css` and `index.html` files are linked, which you can see in the `<head></head>` tag, so you don't have to worry about that. 

- For the icons, you can use font awesome which has already been linked in the `<head></head>` tag.
  
- Note about the layout: focus primarily on the layout grid. Use your knowledge of CSS grids and Flexbox to tackle it.

- Implement and assign proper sizes for the assets. The page should be responsive, hence use media queries for different sizes.

- Assets and information about fonts and color schemes are given below. However, feel free to use your own.

## Design tokens

We want to make sure that our site has a consistent look and feel, that's why we use _design tokens_.


**If you find it difficult to use these tokens, or if you're not able to achieve a result you're happy with, don't worry about it.** 

### Font

3 fonts is used in this project: `Teko`, `Poppins` and `Raleway`. You can find these fonts on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Color schemes

Primary: `#B8A98D` and `#F0EDE8`
Secondary: `#FFFFFF` and `#000000`
